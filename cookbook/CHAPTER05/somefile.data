Hello,

Sorry to hear about the domain transfer issues you've experienced. The payment method on file at the time of your transfer request was unable to process the payment, and this caused the transfer to fail. I've reviewed your account and can confirm the payment method on file now is now ready to accept payments, so you will just need to request another transfer of this domain to complete the transaction.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Best regards,

Stephen H
